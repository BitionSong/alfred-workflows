Use hotkeys to launch actions by pressing a key combination. You can connect one or more actions to be performed.

Hotkeys are stripped on import, to ensure that they don't clash with your existing hotkeys, so double-click the object and set your own hotkey.

A hotkey needs to contain a modifier (Cmd, Ctrl or Alt) and a keyboard character at least, but your best bet is to use slightly less common combinations (e.g. two modifiers) to avoid clashing with default OS X hotkeys or other apps on your Mac.
